# COMP-305 (ALGORITHMS&COMPLEXITY) PROJECT (Tribal Shaman King Selection)
Emre Düzakın, Barış Kaplan, Berke Can Rızai, Eren Barış Bostancı 


Completed steps: 
1-) Meeting
2-) Discussing the problem
3-) Coming up with some brief ideas
4-) Completion of the major parts(finding the min delegates needed, finding the min_population_votes_needed, and etc.)






To Do List: 
1-) Meet 
2-) Discuss the problem
3-) Come up with some ideas
4-) Try to find best idea to solve the problem.
5-) Prepare a presentation about the time&space complexity of the algorithm, about the ideas that we proposed, and also about our final idea to solve the tribal shaman king selection problem.
